# PiGallery

## PiGallery: AI-powered Self-hosted Secure Multi-user Image Gallery and Detailed Image analysis using Machine Learning, EXIF Parsing and Geo Tagging

<br>

## Key features

### At it's core, **PiGallery** builds a searchable database of images  

- Image thumbnails for fast display
- Image analysis using machine learning using multiple image classification and object detection models
- Image perception hash to quickly locate duplicate image regardless of size or to search for similar images
- Image conditions using analysis of camera settings (light, dark, zoom, wide, etc.)
- Person age, gender & emotion modelling and NSFW classification
- Image geo-location including nearest city for quick searches
- Lexicon definitions for complete image description

### As an image gallery viewer, **PiGallery** provides

- Secure, multi-user access to image database
- Fully responsive design for desktop & mobile usage
- Installable as an application (PWA) or can be used as a web page
- Client-side caching with incremental updates
- Flexible sorting and navigation using folders, locations or classes
- Flexible natural language search
- Quickly share generated albums with public users
- Locate and select images on a world map
- Find duplicate and/or similar images
- View image slideshow
- Multiple display themes (light & dark) and fully configurable user interface
- Play with machine learning detection of live video using your camera

### And on a server side

- Analysis is always incremental so only new or modified images will be analyzed
- All data is stored in a server-side database and original image is never modified

### And it's **FAST**

- Initial access (no cache) of database with 10,000 images completes in less than 1 minute  
  (depending on your network speed)
- Subsequent access (cached) with incremental database updates:
  less than 5 seconds for application startup and gallery load

<br>

*If you'd like to include any additional image analysis (additional machine models or static analysis), drop a note!*

## General Notes

### Metadata

Processing builds tags from all available image metadata:

- Image Metadata:
  - Size, Creation and Modification timestamps
  - Camera & lens details and settings used for image capture
  - Software used for editing, etc.
  - GPS Coordinates
    Matched to location database for place description and location of nearest larger center for purpose of groupping
- Image Analysis
  - Multiple iamge classification models
  - Multiple object detection models
  - Face age/gender/emotion detection
  - NSFW detection
  - Perception hash calculation
    Used to compare image similarity between any images or to find similar images
- Lexicon lookups for any detected terms
  - This includes hierarchical lookups - for example, *gown* will also include *dress, clothing, etc.*

Collected metadata is additionally analyzed to render human-readable search terms

- Age can be specified as: *20ies, 30ies, kid, old, etc.*
- Camera settings can be specified as: *bright, dark, indoors, outdoors, etc.*
- Lens settings can be specified as: *superzoom, zoom, portrait, wide, ultrawide*
- Special words can be used in search terms to form a sentence: *the, a, in, wearing, having, etc.*

<br>

### Image Processing

- If you get `Error: Failed to link vertex and fragment shaders`, you've run out of GPU memory.  
  Just restart processing and it will continue from the last known good result.  
  But if it continues, you need to reduce number of active models or use smaller models.  
- Model load time can be from few seconds to over a minute depending on model size (in MB)
- Model warm-up time can be from few seconds to over a minute depending on model complexity (number of tensors)
- Once models are loaded and ready, actual processing is ~0.1sec - ~1sec per image
- Image analysis is maximized out-of-the-box for a GPU-accelerated system using WebGL acceleration and GPU with minimum of 4GB of memory  
  For high-end systems with 8GB or higher, you can further enable ImageNet 21k models  
  For low-end systems with 2GB or less, enable analysis based on MobileNet v2 and EfficientNet B0 and do not use complex models  
- Usage without GPU acceleration is not recommended  
  Note that GPU is not required for image gallery, only for initial processing  

<br>

### Search

Result of all metadata processing is a very flexbile search engine - take a look at this example:  

  `"Happy female in 20ies in Miami wearing dress and dining outdoors"`

<br>

### Navigation

#### Keyboard shortcuts

```text
  ENTER : Execute any open input
  ESC   : Close any dialogs and reset view
  \     : Reload data
  /     : Open search input
  .     : Open sort interface
  ,     : Show/hide image descriptions in gallery view
  Arrow Left & Right : Previous & Next image when in detailed view
  Arrow Up & Down: Scroll up & down by one line when in gallery view
  Page Up & Down: Scroll up & down by one page when in gallery view
  Home & End: Scroll to start & end when in gallery view
```

#### Swipe controlss

- Swipe down will refresh image database
- Swipe left and right are previous and next image in details view
